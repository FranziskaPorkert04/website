I am a third year PhD student at Bonn University, advised by Claude Duhr working on mathematical methods for the analytic computation of scattering amplitudes and specifically Feynman integrals. I am particularly interested in the special functions appearing in these objects and applying concepts from algebraic geometry to compute them. 

Before coming to Bonn, I obtained a Master's degree in physics in Berlin and Uppsala, completing a Master's thesis on Einstein-Yang-Mills amplitudes. Earlier in my academic journey, I obtained Bachelor's degrees both in Mathematics and Physics in Regensburg. 

Outside of physiscs and maths, I enjoy bouldering, hiking, birdwatching and boardgames.

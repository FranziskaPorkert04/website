**Women* in Physics Bonn**

Together with a group of other researchers, I am organizing the group "Women* in Physics Bonn". 
We aim to build a network of women* at an early state of their career in Physics at the University of Bonn through monthly meetings.
Our participants are mainly Master`s students, PhDs and postdocs, but we also warmly welcome any women* doing a Bachelor`s and interested in connecting with more experienced women* researchers.

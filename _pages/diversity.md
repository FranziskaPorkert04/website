**Bonn Fall HEP Meeting 2024: Embracing Diversity in High Energy Physics**

We are organizing a workshop!

High energy physics (HEP) unites physicists from theory and experiment irrespective of age, gender, or personal background. This is also the aim of our workshop: bringing together people focusing on various aspects of HEP across different career stages. We are particularly excited to amplify the voices of female* physicists while ensuring a diverse and inclusive environment for everyone.

  <p>Together with a group of other researchers, I am organizing the group "Women* in Physics Bonn". 
We aim to build a network of women* at an early state of their career in Physics at the University of Bonn through monthly meetings.
Our participants are mainly Master's students, PhDs and postdocs, but we also warmly welcome any women* doing a Bachelor`s and interested in connecting with more experienced women* researchers.</p>

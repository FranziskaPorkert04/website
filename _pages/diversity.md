**Women* in Physics Bonn**


   Together with a group of other researchers, I am organizing the group "Women* in Physics Bonn".

    We aim to build a network of women* at an early stage of their career in Physics at the University of Bonn through monthly meetings. These include informal meetings as well as talks by invited speakers.

Our participants are mainly Master's students, PhDs and postdocs, but we also warmly welcome any women* doing a Bachelor`s and interested in connecting with more experienced women* researchers.

We have also organised a workshop, see our [Indico Page](https://indico.hiskp.uni-bonn.de/event/568/) .

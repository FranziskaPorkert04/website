I am a fourth year PhD student at Bonn University, advised by Claude Duhr working on mathematical methods for the analytic computation of scattering amplitudes and specifically Feynman integrals.


In June 2025 I am going to join the group of Bernd Sturmfels at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences in Leipzig as a postdoctoral researcher.
